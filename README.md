# global-population-dashboard
Interactive dashboard for a global population dataset

# Overview
The goal is to make use of datasets to reveal insights about the global population. There are provided visuals, and there is also an interactive dashboard.

There is also a machine learning model which is trained on the data and predicts.
# Dataset
There are two datasets, [World Population Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) and [Population by Country - 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanuprabhu/population-by-country-2020) used in this project. Both found on Kaggle.
# Questions
Here are some questions in consideration:
* What are the most populated countries?
* Which countries had the highest population growth?

Here's a line of inquiry:
* Does the urban population percentage help predict population growth?
